# Kanemki

Kanemki is a multipurpose Discord bot developed by me as a summer project. It's still under development and it will need some further improvements and implementations.

If you happen to stumble on this repository looking for pieces of code feel free to look on it, maybe it helps you out, but ***make sure that you understand*** what everything is doing and ***don't just copy paste it***. Otherwise, if you decide to look on it just out of curiosity, don't judge. I'm a beginner dev and I still work on improving my skills.
